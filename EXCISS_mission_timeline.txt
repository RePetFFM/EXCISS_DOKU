[cond][ard]		if shutdown comand recieved do shutdown 


mission loop
------------------------------------------
[exec][ard]		Check for outside data transfer window time frame.
[cond][ard]		Waiting until batterie is charged to mission phase voltage. Keep in mind, don't set the mission start charg leve to 100% due to battery degradation.
[cond][ard]		Waiting for full charg of ignition coil.

[exec][ard]		Switch USB dataswitch to Raspberry PI
[exec][ard]		Power on Raspberry PI

[exec][pi][ard]	Set watchdog GPIO to high for 3 sec and keep it for 3min low. The arduino should try to gracefull shutdown the raspberry, if the watchdog signal is missing for predefined timespan.
[exec][ard][pi]	get date time from arduino via serial read request
[exec][ard][pi]	Read from arduino last stored status and error informations for health logfile.
[exec][pi]		Write health logfile to transfer USB.
[exec][pi]		Check for new config and python code on transfer USB.
[cond][pi][ard]	If mission end kill config information detected. Do finals shutdown. 	
[info][check]	blacklist usb device mounting on booting. 
[check][pi]		check USB A status. Store USB status.
[check][pi]		check USB B status. Store USB status.
[exec][pi]		define [main recording mass storage] based on USB A/B status
[exec][pi]		store health logfile with datetime and incremented integer value (prevent overwriting in case off RTC error) to the active storage.

[exec][pi]		Start main mission
[exec][pi][ard]	turn off all LED's
[exec][pi]		take dark still image for pixel error reference on USB Stick [main recording mass storage]
[exec][pi][ard]	?(turn on shaker for 1 sec)
[exec][pi][ard]	turn on all LED's
[exec][pi]		take 3 still images in 2 sec interval on USB Stick [main recording mass storage]
[exec][pi][ard]	?(turn on shaker for 1 sec)
[exec][pi]		start video recording with high framerate on USB Stick [main recording mass storage]
[cond][pi]		wait 2 sec
[exec][pi][ard]	 ?(turn on shaker for 1 sec and wait 0.5 sec)
[exec][pi][ard]	ignition
[cond][pi]		wait for 3 min
[exec][pi]		stop high frame rate recording
[exec][pi]		start copying in background high frame rate video from USB Stick [main recording mass storage] to transfer USB stick
[exec][pi]		start copying in background high frame rate video from USB Stick [main recording mass storage] to backup USB stick
[exec][pi]		start low frame rate recording / begin still timelaps with burst LED exposure on USB Stick [main recording mass storage]
[cond][pi]		wait for 7 min
[exec][pi][ard]	turn off all LED's
[exec][pi]		start copying low frame rate video from USB Stick [main recording mass storage] to backup USB stick
[exec][ard][pi]	Read from arduino last stored status and error informations for health logfile.
[exec][pi]		Write health logfile to Transfer USB
[exec][pi]		unmount USB sticks
[exec][pi][ard]	send shutdown signal to Arduino via serial
[exec][pi]		shutdown raspberry pi

[exec][ard]		after 2 min arduino turn off Raspi power
[exec][ard]		Arduino swaps USB switch to NanoRacks
[exec][ard]		trigger multiple ignites, to prevent charged capacitor.
[exec][ard]		loop back to mission loop start


[exec][ard]		loop exit conditions
	[cond][ard]		no USB Power for 2 days
	[cond][ard]		OR Mission end Date



power managment loop
------------------------------------------
[cond][ard]		check NanoRacks USB Power status over GPIO
[cond][ard]		check NanoRacks USB Power status over Babysitter
[cond][ard]		check Battery charg level
[store][ard]	store science mission "go" or "no go"
[store][ard]	add store last error bits (must be cleared by raspberry pi via serial command after appending the error codes in downlink transfer logfile).
[store][ard]	store current battery level and any battery health related values.
[store][ard]	store current gauge values, max and min values are stored as peak value.


shutdown
------------------------------------------
[exec][ard]		If raspberry ist still on try gracefull shutdown wait for 3min
