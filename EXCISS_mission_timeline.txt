[ard] = arduino pro mini
[pi] = raspberry pi

pre flight phase
------------------------------------------
[do]			Charg battery to storage voltage.
[do]			Shutdown raspi and arduino.
[check]			RTC must be still powered by lipo.
[check] 		Only powered component is the RTC.
[set][ard]		set USB Switch to transfer mode.
[set][ard]		setting the babysitter battery charg from USB


ISS transfer
------------------------------------------
[info]	Keep in mind, launch can be delayed due bad weather etc. Hence time/date based activation etc. is not a good practice.


ISS USB power first or power restore event
------------------------------------------
[event][ard]	Arduino get power from nanoracks.
[exec][ard]		Arduino increment boot counter and store in eeprom
[exec][ard]		Arduino last boot date time and store in eeprom
[exec][ard]		After bootup, swaping the arduino power source from USB to internal battery.
([exec][ard] Check battery charg level via sparkfun babysitter. )
[exec][ard]		Switch USB dataswitch to NanoRacks


power command loop
------------------------------------------
[event][ard]	USB power state transition detction and decode command (example power on/off sequence 1min off., 1min on, 1min off, 2min on, off).
[cond][ard]		if shutdown comand recieved do shutdown 


mission loop
------------------------------------------
[exec][ard]		Check for outside data transfer window time frame.
[cond][ard]		Waiting until batterie is charged to mission phase voltage. Keep in mind, don't set the mission start charg leve to 100% due to battery degradation.
[cond][ard]		Waiting for full charg of ignition coil.

[exec][ard]		Switch USB dataswitch to Raspberry PI
[exec][ard]		Power on Raspberry PI
[exec][pi]		Check for new config and python code on transfer USB
[exec][pi]		Write health logfile to transfer USB
[check][pi]		check USB A status. Store USB status.
[check][pi]		check USB B status. Store USB status.
[exec][pi]		define [main recording mass storage] based on USB A/B status

[exec][pi]		Start main mission
[exec][pi][ard]	turn off all LED's
[exec][pi]		take dark still image for pixel error reference on USB Stick [main recording mass storage]
[exec][pi][ard]	?(turn on shaker for 1 sec)
[exec][pi][ard]	turn on all LED's
[exec][pi]		take 3 still images in 2 sec interval on USB Stick [main recording mass storage]
[exec][pi][ard]	?(turn on shaker for 1 sec)
[exec][pi]		start video recording with high framerate on USB Stick [main recording mass storage]
[cond][pi]		wait 2 sec
[exec][pi][ard]	 ?(turn on shaker for 1 sec and wait 0.5 sec)
[exec][pi][ard]	ignition
[cond][pi]		wait for 3 min
[exec][pi]		stop high frame rate recording
[exec][pi]		start copying in background high frame rate video from USB Stick [main recording mass storage] to transfer USB stick
[exec][pi]		start copying in background high frame rate video from USB Stick [main recording mass storage] to backup USB stick
[exec][pi]		start low frame rate recording / begin still timelaps with burst LED exposure on USB Stick [main recording mass storage]
[cond][pi]		wait for 7 min
[exec][pi][ard]	turn off all LED's
[exec][pi]		start copying low frame rate video from USB Stick [main recording mass storage] to backup USB stick
[exec][pi]		Write health logfile to Transfer USB
[exec][pi]		unmount USB sticks
[exec][pi][ard]	send shutdown signal to Arduino via serial
[exec][pi]		shutdown raspberry pi

[exec][ard]		after 2 min arduino turn off Raspi power
[exec][ard]		Arduino swaps USB switch to NanoRacks
[exec][ard]		loop back to mission loop start

[exec][ard]		loop exit conditions
	[cond][ard]		no USB Power for 2 days
	[cond][ard]		OR Mission end Date


shutdown
------------------------------------------
[exec][ard]		If raspberry ist still on try gracefull shutdown wait for 3min
[exec][ard]		Turn off all LED's
[exec][ard]		Turn off Raspberry
[exec][ard]		Turn off Arduino
[info]			If USB power is restored then "ISS USB power first or power restore event" must be triggered.


sample return
------------------------------------------
[info]		keep it turn off


data extraction
------------------------------------------
[do]		pull USB Sticks


data analysis
------------------------------------------
